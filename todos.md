* Turn into Flask app with Celery stuff so I can repeatedly send new files to deal with. Maybe Dockerize. Why not?
* Develop better way to deal with artist metadata and avoid explicitly specifying directories and songs. Maybe can integrate with that terminal-based music manager?
* Parallelize where possible. Celery would actually take care of that.
* Make more robust to errors.
